`cd` into `my-app` and run `npm install` to install the dependencies on your local machine.

run `npm start` to run locally.

To deploy, run `npm run deploy` on your local machine. NOTE: It will deploy whatever state your local files reflect, and has nothing to do with files that have been pushed/comitted to github. (Making changes locally and deploying will deploy the local version without affecting the comitted/pushed files). This allows you to quickly toggle between deployed versions of the site by switching between branches on your local machine and deploying (for example, to temporarily put up a maintenence page, or similar).
